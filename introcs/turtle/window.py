"""
The drawing window for Python graphics

This module replaces the classic, singleton turtle window with a version that is safer
for modern implementations of Tkinter.  In particular, while the Window can be interacted
with in the main thread, it has an asynchronous drawing queue under the hood for
processing Tkinter commands properly.

To understand this interface, pay close attention to the method names.  Any method that
is not hidden (no underscore) is safe to be accessed in the main thread.  The same is
true for hidden methods without the prefix ``_tk``, though those should be only be accessed
by a ``:class:_DrawTool`` object. These methods are expected to obtain a lock whenever
they access attributes shared between the Tk thread and the main thread.

Methods that start with the prefix ``_tk`` are executed in the Tkinter thread and have
access to the full features of Tkinter. To prevent reentrant locks, we do not acquire a
lock in any method with prefix ``_tk_internal``. Those are assumed to be helper methods
inside of a lock.

While turtle windows may be resized, take great care when resizing them while
drawing.  Since the origin is typically the center of the window, resizing a
turtle window will shift the drawing implements (``Turtle`` and ``Pen`` objects)
to a new position.  For the most part, this should preserve coordinates, but
round-off error may be an issue.
