   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Geometry Classes
================

These classes provide basic point and vector objects, as well as a matrix to support
affine transformations. They is not meant to be an exhaustive linear algebra packet. 
They are primarily for in class demonstrations and simple graphics assignments.  

These classes are generally introduced once we have finally seen classes (particularly
operators). They are significantly more advanced classes than the color models.
