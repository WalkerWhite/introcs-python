Geometry Classes
================

These classes provide basic point and vector objects, as well as a matrix to support
affine transformations. They is not meant to be an exhaustive linear algebra packet. 
They are primarily for in class demonstrations and simple graphics assignments.  These
are much more advanced classes than the color models, and so come much later in the
course.
