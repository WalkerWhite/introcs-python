Color Classes
=============

``import introcs``

We provide classes for three different color models: RGB, CMYK, HSV. Each of these classes
have methods to allow them to be used in popular graphic packages like ``tkinter``, ``kivy``
and ``PIL``. We also support parsing string color representations such as TCL/Tk color
names, or web colors (e.g. ``'#ff00ff'``).
